This program seals away a message which will take some configurable duration
to open.

Usage:
    ./timelock seal <duration> <message> <outfile>
    ./timelock open <sealed_file>
<duration> is expressed in seconds.


Example:
$ time ./timelock seal 20 "hello world" hello.sealed
Measuring decryption speed for 10 seconds...
This computer can do about 33277 decryptions per seconds of 1 blocks of 16 bytes.
So we will encrypt 665540 times to make it last 20 seconds to decrypt.
